# Blockchain Voting System

Blockchain project BlockChainReaction.

A voting system that uses blockchain technology.

## Overview
Blockchain implementation using the DPoS consensus algorithm.

The miner runs a blockchain server and collects the votes from the web user interface. Those votes are then added to the blocks and mined with the DPoS algorithm.

Every user logs in using his id (private key) to the web interface and chooses one from a set of candidates. Then a 'transaction' is applied with the selected candidate's data in the transaction.

## Remaining Tasks
* Run the blockchain on a server
* Modify the blockchain transactions into votes
* Use the DPoS algorithm
* User Interface (web)
